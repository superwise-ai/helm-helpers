This repo contains Helm helper charts.  
The main goal is to create a library of charts that can ease the deployment of resources and replace long Kubernetes YAML files.  
Helm [library charts](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/library_charts/) are also a great fit for this project.

## Quickstart
```sh
$ helm repo add helm-helpers https://superwise-ai.github.io/helm-helpers
$ helm install helm-helpers/<chart>
```
